# Global AI & Research Events Repository  
### by Naman Dixit 
## Repository Overview  
This repository documents my participation in international academic conferences, university-led research events, and corporate innovation summits related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Data Science (DS), and NBIC (Nano, Bio, Info, Cogno/Neuro) Converging Technologies.  

It consolidates event records, participation details, presentation notes (where applicable), and official certifications of attendance or recognition from institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA), Stanford University, NVIDIA, and Meta.  

The purpose of this repository is to provide a transparent and verifiable record of academic and professional engagement with cutting-edge AI, ML, and emerging technology research ecosystems.
